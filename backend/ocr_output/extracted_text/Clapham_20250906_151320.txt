can speak of individual Tic Tacs, individual shoes and, yes, even individual groups. This is
important because by the 1970s, it had become clear that group rightssometimes called
cultural rights-were as pressing a concern as human (individual) rights. (Engelke, 2017)
This is an important reminder that the turn to the individual does not happen in a vac-

the interests of wealthy investors in developing countries; it developed to punish (includ-
ing by execution) the defeated individuals responsible for aggressive war and certain war
crimes; it was interpreted in orderto protect the dignity of Foreign Ministers in office; and
it evolved to allow individuals to vindicate their human rights through regional human
rights courts. Often the momentum behind these changes has been driven by the aware-
ness of individuals that international law should be harnessed to vindicate certain rights
and punish certain transgressions, and that justice demands that this happens not only at
the interstate level but also at an individual level.
A. THE INDIVIDUAL
'The individual' is defined and conceived in a number ofdifferent ways in the international
legal system. An individual can refer to a human being. When human beings (often refer-
enced in law as 'natural persons') come into contact with the international legal system, it
is often as part of a group of natural persons acting together. For example, groups of indig-
enous people and groups who have the right of self-determination are composed of natu-
ral persons. As such, they could be considered to be 'individuals' within the international
legal system while collectively they might constitute a people entitled to certain rights.
Whether or not an individual can claim that right to self-determination on behalf of the
people is a complex question. The UN Human Rights Committee only admits complaints
from individuals about individual rights and does not allow for complaints concerning
a violation of the rights of the people as such (Schabas, 2019, p 988). And yet the Inter-
American and African regional human rights mechanisms have developed ways of taking
into account the relationship between the individual and an indigenous people in order to
strengthen protection under human rights law (Summers, 2019), and one can argue that
the UN system for the protection of individual and peoples' rights under the Covenants
should adapt to ensure that the interests of the group are properly protected.
Natural persons do form groups in order to advance their interests. One can think of
trade unions and non-governmental organizations (eg Amnesty International, Greenpeace,
and Oxfam). Such groups are legally separate entities from the natural persons that cre-
ate them. Corporations are also separate entities that are formed to further the common
interests of natural and legal persons, and all legal systems recognize the existence and
activities of corporations and acknowledge them as non-natural legal persons (Dine, 2000;
Muchlinski, 2021).
The notion of 'individuals' could arguably include all these types of legal persons, nat-
ural and non-natural. Scholars have sometimes played on this idea that, legally speak-
Ing, when we refer to a 'person' this can include legal persons as well as human persons.
Indeed, in many national contexts where legislation demands that a law applies to 'every
Person' the presumption will often be that this should include legal persons such as corpo-
rations. For example, the 1901 Australian Interpretation Act, Section 2(c)(1) states: 'In any

pIVDUALS IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM
B.
Brierly asked his students the fundamental question: what is the basis of obligation
~:er international law? His answers to that question focus on the idea that individuals
ant order not chaos:
If it were true that the essence of all law is a command, and that what makes the law of the
state binding is that for some reason, for which no satisfactory explanation can ever be
en, the will of the person issuing a command is superior to that of the person receiving
it, then indeed it would be necessary to look for some special explanation of the binding
force of international law. But that view of the nature of law has long been discredited. If
we are to explain why any kind of law is binding, we cannot avoid some such assumption
4a made in the Middle Ages, and in Greece and Rome before that, when they spoke o
<
natural law.
The ultimate explanation of the binding force of all law is that individuals, whether as
single human beings, or whether associated with others in a state, are constrained, in so far
as they are reasonable beings, to believe that order and not chaos is the governing principle
of the world in which they have to live. (Brierly quoted in Clapham, 2012, p 53)
The international legal system was traditionally conceived as a State-based system with
States as the only holders of rights and obligations. The dominant positivist theories
of international law used to consider that '[s]ince the Law of Nations is a law between
States only and exclusively, States only and exclusively are subjects of the Law of Nations'
(Oppenheim, 1905, p 341). A 'subject' of the international legal system has direct rights
and responsibilities under that system, can bring international claims, and, it was argued,
was able to participate in the creation, development, and enforcement of international
law. Historically, under this dominant view, any role for the individual in the international
legal system was purely as an 'object' of that system and not as a 'subject'. In this view,
individuals are objects, in the same sense that territory or rivers are objects of the system
because there are (State-created) legal rules dealing with or protecting them.
This traditional approach is now largely discredited. The reality is that there are many
actors on the international scene in addition to States, and these actors have some inter-
national legal personality. Moreover, the concept of a subject of international law is today
often deemed unhelpful; and scholars increasingly avoid speculation on which non-State
actors can be described as subjects.5 According to Rosalyn Higgins: 'We have all been
held captive by a doctrine that stipulates that all international law is to be divided into
"subjects"-that is, those elements bearing, without the need for municipal interven-
tion, rights and responsibilities; and "objects"that is the rest' (Higgins, 1994, p 49).
Higgins seems to suggest that the whole edifice is built on the myth that we have a rule
for determining when something should be classed as a subject. As the whole enterprise
is constructed by doctrine, it can therefore be dismantled by doctrine. She concludes: 'the
positivist definition assumed that some specific rule is required "permitting" the indi-
vidual to be a "subject" of international law. Finally, the whole notion of "subjects and
"objects" has no credible reality, and in my view no functional purpose. We have erected
an intellectual prison of our own choosing and then declared it to be an unalterable con-
straint' (Higgins, 1994, p 49; see also Higgins, 1979).
One can make a similar case with regard to personality. Personality is a central concept
in domestic legal systems; the concept allows judges to know whether an entity exists for

Paris: Pedone (2005).

the purposes of the national legal system. Each system may have its own particularities-
'Rights have been ascribed to white elephants in Siam and cats in Egypt' (Phillips, 195
p 252). By contrast, international law has no such mechanism for determining personal#j
or, come to that, subjectivity. As Jan Klabbers concludes: 'After all is said and done, person.
ality in international law, like "subjectivity", is but a descriptive notion: useful to describe
a state of affairs, but normatively empty, as neither rights nor obligations flow automati-
cally from a grant of personality' (Klabbers, 2002, p 57). He has punctured the debate by
concluding that being 'a "subject" of any legal system is merely academic shorthand, and in
itself not worth much unless accompanied by certain legal rights' (Klabbers, 2021, p 136).
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) addressed the issues of the subjects of interna.
tional law and international personality in its Reparationsfor Injuries Advisory Opinion:
The subjects of law in any legal system are not necessarily identical in their nature or
in the extent of their rights, and their nature depends on the needs of the community.
Throughout its history, the development of international law has been influenced by the
requirements of international life, and the progressive increase in the collective activi-
ties of States has already given rise to instances of action upon the international plane by
certain entities which are not States... In the opinion of the Court, the [United Nations]
Organisation was intended to exercise and enjoy, and is in fact exercising and enjoying,
functions and rights which can only be explained on the basis of the possession of a large
measure of international personality and the capacity to operate upon an international
plane... That is not the same thing as saying that it is a State, which it certainly is not, or
that its legal personality and rights and duties are the same as those of a State ... It does
not even imply that all its rights and duties must be upon the international plane, any more
than all the rights and duties of a State must be upon that plane. What it does mean is that
it is a subject of international law and capable ofpossessing international rights and duties,
and that it has capacity to maintain its rights by bringing international claims."
This clarifies that there can indeed be subjects of the international legal system that are
not States. These subjects do not all possess the same rights and duties, and not all of
these rights and duties need to be on the international plane alone. It also explains how
the international legal system has developed, and continues to develop, in ways that allow
non-State actors to have international legal personality and so to act independently in the
international legal system (Nijman, 2004; Peters, 2016; McCorquodale, 2017).
It has been argued for some time that, rather than the State being the primary 'sub-
ject' of the international legal system, the primary 'subject' is the individual (Scelle, 1932).
More recently Anne Peters explains:
The individual has become a primary subject (person) of international law. Individuals
not only have numerous 'subjective' international rights (in the plural) but are also further
entitled to international legal subjectivity (international legal personality) in virtue of their
personhood on the basis of customary international law and general principles of law and
as an aspect of their human right to legal personality. Put differently, the international
legal personality of human beings is rooted in Art. 16 ICCPR and already forms a general
principle oflaw. (Peters, 2016, p 8)
The idea of a 'subject' versus 'object' dichotomy has been criticized by a number of writ-
ers, not least because it privileges certain voices and silences others (eg Koskenniemi»
1989; Charlesworth and Chinkin, 2000; Anghie, 2005). Accordingly, if it can be shown

has now clarified, in the context of a dispute over access to consular assistance 4É,]
that there are international rights that belong to individuals, and that these rights n4]
invoked by States in the IC%
While the Opinion ofthe PCIJ confirmed that individuals can have rights derived4,,,
an international treaty, and the IC] confirmed that individual rights can be litigate4
States now before this Court, these rights will not necessarily be enforceable by the 44,,{
individual.
The area where individual rights are most obvious concerns human rights. At one+,
governments considered that how they dealt with their own nationals was not covered 1
international law: as it was considered that only foreigners (aliens) were protected as44
ter of international law (Klabbers, 2021, p 119). It is no longer possible to take this View.
In 1968, the International Conference on Human Rights adopted a text whereby States
solemnly proclaimed that "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states a conn,
understanding ofthe peoples ofthe world concerning the inalienable and inviolable rights
of all members of the human family and constitutes an obligation for the members of the
international community"" Further, States acknowledged in 1993, at the Vienna W4#
Conference on Human Rights that 'the promotion and protection of all human rights is4
legitimate concern of the international community!"
This recognition that States are obliged to respect the human rights ofeveryone was re-
iterated in 2005, when the General Assembly's Summit Outcome Document proclaimed.
'We reaffirm the solemn commitment of our States to fulfil their obligations to promote
universal respect for and the observance and protection of all human rights and fnn
damental freedoms for all in accordance with the Charter, the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and other instruments relating to human rights and international law. The
universal nature ofthese rights and freedoms is beyond question.'11 So first, States have an
obligation to respect the individual's rights in the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights;
second, it is legitimate for other States to raise concern over respect for these rights; and
third, these rights are now universal rights and have to be respected everywhere.
Turning to the detailed content of these rights, and their enforceability as a matter of
law before the Courts, the picture becomes more complex. Human rights are now detailed
in a number oftreaties and their optional protocols. These treaties often have supervisory
mechanisms to monitor compliance with legal obligations, hear complaints about viola-
tions, and, at the regional level, specialized Courts that can deliver legally binding judg-
ments based on complaints brought by individuals under those treaties.
In addition, the IC] may have jurisdiction over disputes between States based on these
treaties or in the context of claims by States concerning violations of the customary in-
ternational law of human rights. The important work of Schabas has shown that it is now
clear that the key human rights can be considered as giving rise to binding obligations
under customary international law (Schabas, 2021). So the human rights obligations of a
State and the rights belonging to individuals extend beyond the treaty obligations of the
States concerned. He identifies, among others: the right to life, the prohibitions on torture,

Despite these very practical examples of individuals being held to account for t+4,,_

free to behave irresponsibly, undermining international rules and violating other people's
human rights.
III.
INTERNATIONAL CLAIMS
The conceptual understanding that individuals have international rights and international
obligations under international law does not automatically mean that such individuals
have the ability to bring international claims in the international legal system. Thus, the
PCIJ declared that 'it is scarcely necessary to point out that the capacity to possess civil
rights does not necessarily imply the capacity to exercise those rights oneself'.24 Instead,
the conclusion reached by most writers is that 'individuals are extremely handicapped in
international law from the procedural point of view' (Higgins, 1994, p 51). Many of the
international institutions that determine claims, such as the ICJ, are not open to individu-
als, even though a significant number of their cases arise from actions which have harmed
individual human beings.
Traditionally, the only means available for individuals to complain about a violation
of international law within the international legal system was when an individual was
able to persuade a government to bring a claim on their behalf, and then it was not the
individual's international rights that were being asserted but the State's own rights.25
The traditional approach still holds that it is up to the State to decide whether or not to
pursue such claims when it comes to the legal institution of'diplomatic protection'. Indeed,
the IC] stated in 1970 that
[t]he State must be viewed as the sole judge to decide whether its protection will be grant-
ed, to what extent it is granted, and when it will cease ... Should the natural or legal per-
sons on whose behalf it is acting consider that their rights are not adequately protected,
they have no remedy in international la 7°
This position was challenged in the UK Courts in a case arising from the internationally
unlawful detention by the USA of individuals in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, following the
2001 invasion ofAfghanistan. In Abbasi v Secretary of StateforForeign and Commonwealth
Affairs the applicant (a British national) sought judicial review of the adequacy of the dip-
lomatic actions of the British government towards the US government concerning his

where the evidence is clear would be difficult, and in extreme cases possibly imposs1~l_e
to refuse. It is unlikely that such a request would ever be refused by government, but I :t
were, the decision would be justiciable, and a court could order the government to ta e
appropriate action.29
Dugard explains that in 'the light of this development the ILC has i~ its ~rticle 1: Draft

sibility of exercising diplomatic protection, especially when a significant injury

;helton, 2015) or e:en to demanding the release of a prisoner or a change in the law.
pp#ah Shelton explains
measures taken include restitution, whenever possible, to restore the victim to the
zation existing before the violation occurred. Restitution can involve return of proPY'
, money, release of detainees, reinstatement of an individual wrongfully or arbitrarilY
qharged, or other measures toeliminate the wrong. Rehabilitation may include medical
ad psychological care as well as legal and social services.
Satisfaction, as a form of reparation, has been important in the human rights field. Sat-
1faction may require cessation; disclosure of the truth; measures to restore the digni} P'
eutation and the rights of the victim; public apology, including acknowledgment of U°
facts and acceptance of responsibility; judicial and administrative sanctions against per-
sons liable for the violations; and commemorations and tributes to the victims. Satisfac-
tion thus includes truth telling, recovery and reburial of victims remains, actions to restore
victim's reputation, apology and commemorations. (Shelton, 2014, p I8O)
Another area of significant growth in the international legal system is in the realm of in-
ternational economic law. Part of this growth has included the creation and development
of mechanisms by which individual investors, usually as corporations, can bring claims
against States. These mechanisms were initially ad hoc international arbitration bodies
and claims commissions to which individuals had access, such as the Iran-US Claims
Tribunal and the UN Compensation Commission. More recently, there has been a growth
in arbitral panels established in the context of international investment disputes, where a
private investor makes claims about unfair treatment by the host State. These panels are
established for each dispute by the parties and often operate with institutional support,
for example from the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (see
Subedi, Ch 25 of this book). Most of the disputes between investors and States in this area
are now resolved by a combination of public and private international law, with decisions
of international bodies enforced through national law, often as a consequence of a treaty
obligation (such as the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement
of Foreign Arbitral Awards).
A major challenge in this area is to balance the rights of the investors and the policies
that a host State government may be seeking to promote. Where these policies concern
the rights of individuals other than the investor's rights-such as labour rights, the right to
a healthy environment, or human rights to health, water, or education-the investment
arbitration regime is faced with competing individual rights. Investment arbitrators may
consider that the parties have given them limited jurisdiction and therefore the human
rights issues (now being raised by the host State to explain why action was taken against
the investor) should be excluded from investment arbitration. These international awards,
enforceable as a matter of international law against the State, have been particularly con-

THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM
295
(in contrast to the more inclusive 'all humanity' idea that had been expounded ear-
~t:;e Indeed, much of our understanding of what the international legal system is, and
"_[,,,would be the role of the individual in it, is continuously affected by the writings of
,,,1duals. For example, jurists who adopted a positivist approach to the international
;: al system and generally considered that the individual had no independent role from
th!t of the State, have been important in identifying rules of customary international law
and persuading States that these rules legally bind them (Oppenheim, 1905). And yet it
has been argued that the positivist concept of international law as a State-based process 'is
incapable of serving as the normative framework for present or future political realities...
new times call for a fresh conceptual and ethical language' (Tesón, 1992, pp 53-4).
Some of the fresh conceptual and ethical language that has been suggested includes
the application of feminist theory to the international legal system, which shows the
limitations of the State as a framework for engagement in gender issues (Charlesworth,
Chinkin, and Wright, 1991), and a recognitionthat relying on constant binary opposi-
tions, such as State versus non-State, cannot produce a coherent international legal system
(Koskenniemi, 1989). Individual scholars have contributed to a 'Third World Approach
to International Law (TWAIL)' in a decentralized network (Gathii, 2011), highlighting
the dangers and potential of international law for those in the Third World as well as the
'deceptive narrative of a universal and objective law' (Bianchi, 2016, p 207; Anghie, 2005).
Other jurists consider that 'the burgeoning canon of individual rights has begun to crack
open the previously encrusted [positivist] Vattelian system' (Franck, 1999, p 281) and that
'we should adjust our intellectual framework to a multi-layered reality consisting of a va-
riety of authoritative structures... [in which] what matters is not the formal status of a
participant... but its actual or preferable exercise of functions' (Schreuer, 1993, p 453).
Others reject the current conceptual parameters and argue for a new understanding of in-
ternational society (Allott, 2001) or even ask us to think about whether we prefer a 'statist'
or 'individualist' rationale for international law, particularly when it comes to justifying
recourse to lethal force in war (Lieblich, 2023).
Each of these conceptual approaches seeks to explain the law-making processes of the
international legal system and, in so doing, offers individual reflections which in turn may
affect how the individual is to be seen in the international system that applies international
law. A striking example of the turn to the individual in thinking about the international
system can be found in the speech of Kofi Annan, as UN Secretary-General, in 2001, on
receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to him and to the UN:
Over the past five years, I have often recalled that the United Nations' Charter begins with
the words: 'We the peoples'. What is not always recognized is that 'We the peoples' are
made up of individuals whose claims to the most fundamental rights have too often been
sacrificed in the supposed interests of the State or the nation.
A genocide begins with the killing of one man-not for what he has done, but because
of who he is. A campaign of 'ethnic cleansing' begins with one neighbour turning on
another. Poverty begins when even one child is denied his or her fundamental right to
education. What begins with the failure to uphold the dignity of one life, all too often ends
With a calamity for entire nations.
In this new century, we must start from the understanding that peace belongs not only
to states or peoples, but to each and every member of those communities. The sovereignty
of States must no longer be used as a shield for gross violations of human rights. Peace
must be made real and tangible in the daily existence of every individual in need.
Peace must be sought, above all, because it is the condition for every member ofthe human
family to live a life of dignity and security.

The rights of the individual are of no less importance to immigrants and minorities in
Europe and the Americas than to women in Afghanistan or children in Africa. They are as
fundamental to the poor as to the rich; they are as necessary to the security of the devel-
oped world as to that of the developing world.
Throughout my term as Secretary-General, I have sought to place human beings at the
centre of everything we do-from conflict prevention to development to human rights.
Securing real and lasting improvement in the lives of individual men and women is the
measure of all we do at the United Nations. (Annan, 2001)
V.
CONSIDERATION OF INDIVIDUAL WORTH
IS CHALLENGING SOME TRADITIONAL
APPROACHES TO INTERNATIONAL LAW
The idea that human dignity, autonomy or worth demand that each individual is owed
respect, is, in some ways, an intuitive idea, and in other ways can be derived from vari-
ous national and international texts as well as from philosophical scholarship and reli-
gious traditions over the centuries (McCrudden, 2013; Dworkin, 1988; Kant, 1785, p 96;
Kant, 1797, pp 198-214; Hinchliffe, 2020). There is considerable scholarship on the ways
in which international human rights law is having an impact on general international law
(Kamminga and Scheinin, 2009). In the realm of writing about the laws of war, there is
a lively debate about what is called the 'individualization of war' (Blum, 2014; Akande,
Welsh, and Rodin, 2023); and there are warnings about the pitfalls of such approaches
(Lieblich, 2021). In the following short sections, on diplomatic immunity, siege starvation,
and reprisals, I want to suggest that judges, law-makers and scholars have departed from
a traditional reading of international law in order to prioritize the worth of the individual.
What is perhaps significant is that there is a consideration of the plight of the individual
in the dispute between two nation-States and the traditional State-centric framework of
international law is adjusted by the individuals contemplating the dilemmas.
A.
DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY
A basic idea related to diplomatic immunity is that the host State will protect a foreign
ambassador from danger and will refrain from arresting or detaining them. At one level
one could perhaps see this as about protecting an individual, but this is not really the case.
Should the sending State wish to do so it can waive the immunity of its ambassador or
diplomatic agent. The right belongs to the sending State not the individual. Indeed the
individual could not waive their own immunity even if they wanted to. If an immunity is
disrespected, it is the sending State that has a complaint under international law.
But what about the individuals affected by the diplomat's actions? The wronged individual
may wish to sue the Ambassador and their sending State. When this results in the host State
upholding the diplomatic or sovereign State immunity, the wronged individual may then
want to complain against the host State claiming a denial of access to justice. And yet the
European Court of Human Rights has so far determined that a denial of access to jus-
tice through the national courts may be proportionately restricted in these circumstances.
The logic is that this restriction on access to justice is justified in order that a State can fulfil
its international obligations regarding diplomatic or State immunity towards other States."

B.
SIEGE STARVATION AS A METHOD OF WARFARE
The idea of a siege was to starve the besieged town into surrender. The rules were draco.
nian: 'The older customary law practice ... permitted a besieging commander to d,
escaping civilians back into the besieged area to increase the pressure on the defending
commander' (UK Ministry of Defence, 2004, p 87). However, the contemporary mil4
manuals are clear that, even if it is no longer acceptable to treat civilians in this way, 'it is
permissible to seek to starve enemy forces into submission' (US Department of Defense,
2016, p 312). 'Siege is a legitimate method of warfare as long as it is directed against enemy
armed forces' (UK Ministry of Defence, 2004, p 87).
We ought to consider the international law logic that allows for starvation in this con-
text. The idea is that State practice and opinio juris over the centuries have accepted that
this is the right of a State at War. To the extent that there was ever a moral interrogation,
the logic is that: 'Attacks can be costly in casualties and incidental loss or damage. A more
effective method may be to encircle enemy forces, cutting them off from supplies and
communications with the outside world and forcing their surrender. The same is true of
besieging a town or stronghold' (UK Ministry of Defence, 2004, p 87). Most of the com-
mentary focuses on the extent to which civilians will suffer, and the rules that exist to
protect them (Gillard, 2019). But new scholarship is questioning the effect of siege on all
individuals qua individuals.
Of course, a trite starting point is that if international law does not prohibit the soldiers
of one State to target and kill the enemy forces of another State (leaving aside the issue of
aggression for a moment), then why should international law be concerned if soldiers are
starved into surrender? Siege is the humanitarian alternative (some might say) as lives will
arguably be saved. But a focus on the individual reminds us that siege is designed to force
individuals to change their minds by making them suffer. In this way it is not so different
from torture, and the torture of individuals, including individual soldiers, is prohibited.
International law can be influenced by our moral appreciation of the individual and the
idea that an individual has an individual will (whether or not human rights law applies to
the case in hand). This point has been developed in depth with considerable sophistica-
tion by Dannenbaum (2021, p 433). He explains what is distinctive about the wrong of
mass starvation. This includes the fact that for him 'it places the bodies and biological
imperatives of the targeted population at war with their political commitments, seeking to
break the will of those with the capacity to make political choices-whether those choices
involve staying or fleeing, supporting the besieged regime or resisting it, or advocating or
opposing capitulation'. He focuses on the individuals' bodies and 'biological imperatives'
and asks us to think about what it is to be an individual human being:
The capacity to form and act upon higher-order desires and the specific manifestation of
that capacity in love, social connection, and political cooperation are essential aspects of
our humanity. Just as torture is a mechanism by which the victim is turned against herself,
starvation is a mechanism by which society is turned against itself, with individuals suffer-
ing a direct assault on their fundamental human capacities. (Dannenbaum, 2021, p 434)

own civilian population be subjected to serious and deliberate attacks by the other State
(UK Ministry of Defence, 2004, p 423; US Department of Defense, 2016, p 1115). Whet#
or not such a position is acceptable or valid as a matter of international law, the spec#4j
ized doctrine has recently sought to distinguish reprisals against a State that only affects
damage to inanimate objects and attacks in reprisal that affect individual human beings.
It seems that there is something about harm to individual humans that disrupts the
theoretical application of an international law focused on the rights and obligations of
States. The most recent commentary on this issue by Dinstein (2022, p 348) is telling: 'In
the opinion of the present writer, it is necessary to draw a distinction between belligerent
reprisals targeting civilian persons and objects. The exclusion of civilian persons from the
lawful scope of belligerent reprisals... spurred by basic precepts of human rights law,
does not imply that every inanimate civilian object must be equally protected: In short,
even where it is argued that the laws of war can be broken in reprisal, this should not
apply where this harms individual human beings as opposed to inanimate objects. There
is something special about individuals.
VI.
CONCLUSION
Individuals clearly contribute a lot to how we think about international law. Writers, teach-
ers, bloggers, podcasters, and so on are all influencers. Each of us has a role to play. But
as a doctrinal matter, the role of the individual in the international legal system remains
contentious. And in practice, individuals do not have the same opportunities as States to
develop and enforce international law. The extent to which individuals, or groups of indi-
viduals, can seize international bodies or claim international rights before national courts
is determined by States. Of course, granting individuals increasing access to procedures
to secure their rights sounds like the sort of progressive thing that everyone should be in
favour of. But if these procedures favour the powerful over others there is a problem for
the individuals potentially disempowered by this process. We need to be vigilant when
international legal processes grant privileged access and rights to individuals. We ought
to be not just aware of, but also wary of, individuals insisting on their right to fix the price
of water without regard to the individuals denied access to affordable water. We need to
think of ways to ensure that the protection of an individual's freedom is not instrumental
in the denigration and degradation of others on grounds of their colour, ethnicity or gen
der. Enshrining the international privacy rights of a violent householder at the expense of
the State's power to protect others from domestic violence is not progress. Progress is not
always about finding more room for individuals and less room for the State.
Similarly, while we can celebrate that individuals are now endowed by international
law with their own rights, including human rights, to focus on individual victims and the
prospect of them achieving justice in the courts, including directly before international
courts, may mean we miss the opportunity to struggle to address structural problems
in society and work for legislative and other changes (Luedke and Logan, 2018; Henry
2014). And, while it must be progress that individual perpetrators can be held account-
able for committing crimes under international law, in our enthusiasm to focus on war
crimes we may start to forget about the wider and perhaps more preventive obligations
that exist. Concentrating on punishment rather than precaution and prevention narrows
our field of vision so that we risk focusing on narrowly defined war crimes that are to0
dependent on the exact state of mind of the individual at the time, and not the structural
steps that a State or armed group needs to take to respect and ensure respect for the Jaws
of war (Blum, 2023).
